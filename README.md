## Functionality
* Bullet main uses for SIDELINE 


## Prerequisites 
### General 
- Python >= 3.5
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- Optional: CUDA 
### Required Python Packages 
- numpy
- pandas
- random
- heapq
- copy
- os
- sys
- matplotlib
- pylab
- networkx
- argparse
- bambi
- scipy
- scanpy
- time
- arviz
- math
- argparse
- warnings 
- shutil
### Data
Required: Two scRNA-seq datasets, one case and one control
Format: A non-normalized CSV file with genes as rows and cells as columns. **Genes must be in first column of CSV file** 

*Note: Case and control datasets should either be the same cell type and two different experimental conditions OR the same experimental condition and two different cell types* 
##### Sample Datasets 
There are multiple sample datasets under the [Data folder](https://github.com/chenyongrowan/SIDELINE/tree/main/Data). 
1. The [ProstateCancer](https://github.com/chenyongrowan/SIDELINE/tree/main/Data/ProstateCancer) folder contains datasets for 4 patients. The cells were processed to now contain only endothelial cells. 
2. The [RemoteMemoryFormation](https://github.com/chenyongrowan/SIDELINE/tree/main/Data/RemoteMemoryFormation) folder contains datasets from 2 papers. Both datasets contain only neurons. (FC = Fear Conditioned). The [Rao-Ruiz](https://github.com/chenyongrowan/SIDELINE/tree/main/Data/RemoteMemoryFormation/Rao-Ruiz) dataset is smaller, demonstrating functionality with a small cell count.
